# Autofix Report

## Iteration 1
- Ran `setup.sh --modern` but apt repository addition failed due to malformed entry. Fixed the script by removing line break in Debian repo entry.
- Ran `setup.sh` again; apt failed to install packages due to container restrictions.
- Installed `meson` and `ninja` with pip.
- Configured native build using `meson` with `-Dc_std=c2x`.
- Build failed due to `-std=c23` flag from shared flags; updated flags to `-std=c2x`.
- Build then failed due to invalid header `include/nk_spinlock.h` containing test code. Removed file and updated `src/nk_spinlock.c` to include `nk_superlock.h` instead.

Build still fails due to complex compile errors in examples/vini.c and tests. Additional work required.
